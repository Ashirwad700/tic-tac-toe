Made my first project that is  a tic-tac-toe game with the code that was on geeks-for-geeks website , i understand what i wrote but as a beginner it is very hard for me to visualize and write my project so thats the reason
i hope i will better in future (also i dont know what eaxctly should be written in readme so forgive me )
